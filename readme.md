# StoryMap Workshop

## What is this?
This repository holds most of the files and links needed to complete the Story Maps tutorial for Media, Culture and Heritage students at Newcastle University.

## The Workshop
The purpose of this workshop is for students to:
* develop their digital story telling skills
* understand how to plan and execute a digital story given a set of media assets
* reflect on how stories __take place__ by using maps as a way to organize the story
* become familiar with esri's [StoryMaps platform](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) as one tool for building a story map

By the end of the workshop, students will have planned, built and tested a story map exploring a dimension (of their choosing) of the public history of coal mining in Newcastle upon Tyne.

## Existing Online Histories of Mining in Newcastle
This is a partial list of existing histories of mining that may be useful for data, context and/or inspiration. 

* Heaton History Group [map](https://heatonhistorygroup.org/where/)
    * This is the organisation that placed the plaques included below.
    * There is more information on their website about Heaton and mining.
* Newcastle University Library's [History of Mining](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/libraryassets/external/education-outreach-mining/index.php)
    * This is an older project that no longer works well, but has many of the elements that we are looking for in this workshop.
    * It also has links to important primary sources.

* The Ouseburn Trust's Victoria Tunnel page

* Wagonway Routes [Tyneside Council Page](https://my.northtyneside.gov.uk/category/244/waggonways-routes)
    * "The historic 19th century Waggonways network was once used to haul coal to ships on the River Tyne from dozens of coal mines in the borough. They had fallen into disrepair over many years."



## What you will need for the workshop

### Historic Maps
The [National Library of Scotland](https://maps.nls.uk/) has done a remarkable job of scanning, [georeferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing "the process where a scanned image is transformed and bound to modern spatial data") and hosting historic maps of the UK, including these historic Ordnance Survey (OS) maps that we will use as a "base map" for our story maps.

Because these maps are reproduced under a [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/), it is extremely important that they be properly attributed whenever and wherever they are used in a project.
