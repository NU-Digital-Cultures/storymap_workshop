# StoryMap Workshop for Newcastle University

## What is this?
This repository holds most of the files and links needed to complete the Story Maps tutorial for Media, Culture and Heritage students at Newcastle University.

## The Workshop
The purpose of this workshop is for students to:
* develop their digital story telling skills
* understand how to plan and execute a digital story given a set of media assets
* reflect on how stories __take place__ by using maps as a way to organize the story
* become familiar with esri's [StoryMaps platform](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) as one tool for building a story map

By the end of the workshop, students will have worked in small groups to have planned, built and tested a story map exploring a dimension (of their choosing) of the public history of coal mining in Newcastle upon Tyne.

## Pre-Workshop Preparation
Students will work in small groups to build a storymap using the storymaps.com platform. Prior to the workshop students should do the following
* Create a login at storymaps.com
    * You can use your @ncl.ac.uk email address or any email you'd like, as long as you remember it.
    * make sure to keep track of your password
* Watch the tutorial video on canvas and explore the sample storymap [here](https://storymaps.com/stories/37f1420ed41544dbbbdf0883723c3187)
* Explore the resources below. They are organised in two different categories:
    * [Existing Online Histories of Newcastle](#existing-online-histories-of-mining-in-newcastle)
        * These are a good way to learn more about how other institutions have documented and narrated the history of mining and its impacts on the city.
        * They are not technically story maps, but will give you a grounding in the kinds of stories being told with these resources.
    * [Sources for Images and Information](#sources-for-more-images-and-information)
        * These are websites and archives that have many more images related to coal mining than those we've included as part of the workshop.
        * Many also contain more information and context that may be useful in your story.
*Familiarise yourself with the media used in the workshop.
    * We will use these initial images and links below to create a storymap. The project will go more smoothly if you've looked over them before the workshop.
    * Similarly, if you familiarise yourself with the historic OS maps [linked below](#historic-maps), especially the interface for navigating the maps, you will have more time during the workshop to develop your story.

## Existing Online Histories of Mining in Newcastle
This is a partial list of existing histories of mining that may be useful for data, context and/or inspiration. Look at these to get a sense of how other organizations have mapped some of this history.

* Heaton History Group [map](https://heatonhistorygroup.org/where/)
    * This is the organisation that placed the plaques included below.
    * There is more information on their website about Heaton and mining.
* Newcastle University Library's [History of Mining](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/libraryassets/external/education-outreach-mining/index.php)
    * This is an older project that no longer works well, but has many of the elements that we are looking for in this workshop.
    * It also has links to important primary sources.

* The Ouseburn Trust's Victoria Tunnel page

* Wagonway Routes [Tyneside Council Page](https://my.northtyneside.gov.uk/category/244/waggonways-routes)
    * "The historic 19th century Waggonways network was once used to haul coal to ships on the River Tyne from dozens of coal mines in the borough. They had fallen into disrepair over many years."



## What you will need for the workshop

### Historic Maps
The [National Library of Scotland](https://maps.nls.uk/) has done a remarkable job of scanning, [georeferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing "the process where a scanned image is transformed and bound to modern spatial data") and hosting historic maps of the UK, including these historic Ordnance Survey (OS).

Because these maps are reproduced under a [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/), it is extremely important that they be properly attributed whenever and wherever they are used in a project.

#### Northumberland 1858
[Ordnance Survey "Six Inch" 1830s-1880s maps.](https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=13.0&lat=54.98140&lon=-1.61307&layers=257&b=9&o=100)

We will use this map to explore some of the locations referenced in the photos below.

**Newcastle University** has an excellent digitized collection of etchings of 19th century mining sites -- from the surface -- done by Thomas Hair. The full collection can be viewed on their site [here](https://cdm21051.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p21051coll19/search?_gl=1*1iv7d99*_ga*MTAwMDI2MTM5Mi4xNzAyNjA2NTE4*_ga_T1LDLFZBFY*MTcxMDIzNDg5NS4xLjEuMTcxMDIzNDkwOC4wLjAuMA..). A few samples relevant to the Coxlodge trail are also included below.

Local Photographer Jim Scott has additional etchings and drawings on his [website](https://www.jimscott.co.uk/Collieries/000_Collieries_gallery.html).

**Durham Mining Museum** (website)[http://www.dmm.org.uk/] has the most exhaustive information on specific mines. They also have an excellent image collection, with all images watermarked.

**Co-Curate** has an eclectic set of mining related images, many drawn from flickr. Search the collection [here](https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/resources/add/search/?q=miner&specific_region=)


**The Beamish Museum** has a "[People's Collection](http://collections.beamish.org.uk/)" of historic mining documents and other images and objects related to miners lives. As of 2024 the site can be quite slow and difficult to navigate, but there are many pieces available here not to be found elsewhere.
